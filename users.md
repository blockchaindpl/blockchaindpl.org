# Blockchain DPL Users

This page contains a list of known BDPL Users.

To be an User of the BDPL, you need to make a statement on a publicly available website saying that you commit to offer any patents you have or obtain, under the BDPL to anyone who makes a similar commitment (an “Offering Announcement”) and then, when you contact another BDPL user to accept the license to its patents, you provide it with the URL for the website where you posted your commitment.

You should also email your Offering Announcement URL to the BDPL organizers at offering<span style="display:none"></span>@blockchaindpl.org so others can contact you to accept your licenses. Please also include your valid contact information and a list of your patents (including country of issue, patent no., and title).
